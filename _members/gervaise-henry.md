Gervaise obtained his master’s degree at American University in 2014. He joined Dr. Strand’s lab in 2015. His previous experience involved the utilization of a diverse set of molecular techniques to investigate cancer biology. He also has a strong background in early-stage drug discovery, including the use of lab robotics. After a very successful fellowship with UT Southwestern Bioinformatics Department’s Bioinformatics Core Facility (BICF), he transitioned to a more computational role in the lab. He is responsible for the analysis of sequencing, in particular single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. He also builds pipelines for automated analysis, and tools for easy data exploration.

Gervaise has moved on to work at DNAnexus in 2021 and his contact info is accessible at his personal website.
