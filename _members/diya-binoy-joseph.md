Diya joined the Strand lab in January 2019 as a postdoctoral researcher. Prior to this, she received her Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut in India in 2013 and a Ph.D in Cellular and Molecular Biology in December 2018 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During her doctoral studies in Dr. Chad Vezina’s lab, Diya studied the development of the lower urinary tract with special emphasis on the role of DNA methylating enzymes during prostate development. During her doctoral studies, Diya was part of a collaborative project with Dr. Strand to produce the first cellular anatomy of the normal human prostate at single cell resolution. This collaboration led to her current position as a postdoctoral researcher in the Strand lab where she studies Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and the role of novel club and hillock urethral cell types in BPH growth. In 2022, Diya began her own lab at InStem in Bangalore, India.
