Omkar joined the Strand Lab as a STARS student (Science Teach Access to Resources at Southwestern) in the summer of 2024. He is a high school senior at TAG Townview. As part of his poster project, he worked on mapping cell characterizations in genes such as NR3C4 (androgen receptors), SLPI, and KRT5 in the seminal vesicle and vas deferens through techniques involving RNA scope, immunofluorescence, and bioinformatics under R/Python. With a long-term focus on medical sciences, he hopes to continue pursuing research involving cellular biology. Outside the lab, he enjoys making music, running rounds at his local free clinic, developing community app projects, and leading his schoolâ€™s Biology/STEM writing clubs.
