John earned his Ph.D. in Free Radical and Radiation Biology in 2017 with Prabhat Goswami at the University of Iowa. He then joined the Department of Urology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in 2017 as a postdoctoral fellow with Aditya Bagrodia and James Amatruda. In these roles, Johnâ€™s research focused on overcoming therapy resistance in cancer and the development of improved methods for the detection of minimal residual germ cell tumors. Since joining the Strand Lab in 2022, John has been focused on the computational analysis of single cell and spatial transcriptomics data, and the development of methods to democratize the analysis and access of these data.
