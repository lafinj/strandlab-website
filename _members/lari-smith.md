Lari joined the Strand Lab in 2024 as a graduate student in the Cellular and Molecular Biology program at UT Southwestern. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the California State University, Dominguez Hills. Prior to joining the lab, Lari worked with Dr. Erin McCauley and her project focused on the purification and structural elucidation of natural products from marine organisms that exhibited various biological activity. Her current research interests include understanding the cellular pathogenesis of benign urologic conditions such as detrusor dysfunction and the urethral response to urinary tract infection. When Lari isnâ€™t in lab, she enjoys spending time with her dog Pinky.
