She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the California State University, Dominguez Hills. Prior to joining the lab, Lari worked with Dr. Erin McCauley and her project focused on the purification and structural elucidation of natural products from marine organisms that exhibited various biological activity. Her research interest included understanding the urethral response to urinary tract infection. When Lari wasnâ€™t in lab, she enjoyed spending time with her dog Pinky.
