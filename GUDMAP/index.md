The **GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project** (GUDMAP) is a consortium of laboratories working to provide the scientific and medical community with curated data and tools to facilitate research on the GenitoUrinary (GU) tract. Since its inception, GUDMAP has focused on the urogenital, kidney and urinary tract (ureter, bladder and urethra) regions of human, mouse and other model organisms. GUDMAP produced numerous public datasets and resources for the research community, hosted on its own site and later by the ATLAS-D2K center. In July 2025, the ATLAS-D2K project was sunsetted. GUDMAP data remains available in public repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus ([GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)), the Jackson Laboratory's Mouse Genome Informatics ([MGI](https://www.informatics.jax.org/)), and the Chan Zuckerburg Initiative's [CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/). We collect and preserve the various tutorials and other resources GUDMAP generated over its lifetime here.
