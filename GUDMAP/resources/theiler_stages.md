# Theiler Stage Reference

The GUDMAP repository uses Theiler stages to describe age stages in mouse specimen. This page includes a reference table of the approximate correlation between Theiler Stages and dpc.

The definitions of **Theiler stages** used in GUDMAP, and their relationship to days post-coitum (dpc), are those that appeared on the EMAP website (no longer active, but you can [find the paper here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/Jax_GSA/IMGC2005_Workshop/emage_tutorial.pdf)).

Each Theiler stage is identified with one ‘average’ age, and a range of variation of real ages, centering on this average, that can be seen when real developing embryos are studied.
